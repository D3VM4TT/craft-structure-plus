# Structure Plus
Structure Plus is a Craft CMS plugin designed to streamline and enhance the authorship experience by providing a cohesive, single-view approach to site management and navigation. With easy access to the entire site structure, authors can quickly view all entries in a channel or create new ones, making content management faster and more intuitive.

In Craft CMS, managing content across Singles, Channels, and Structures can be confusing for authors. Structure Plus encourages a new approach to site setup by leveraging Entry Types instead of relying heavily on Singles for channel content like “News.” This lets you organise your entire site within one unified Structure, rather than isolating key pages as Singles.

Like many Craft CMS developers, we have roots in ExpressionEngine, where the Structure plugin revolutionised content management. Its single-view site structure let authors see the entire content layout at a glance, making content editing more intuitive and significantly reducing authoring time. We’ve now brought this streamlined experience to Craft CMS.

## Features
-   **Unified site view**: See the entire site structure in one, easy-to-navigate view. Ideal for authors who want to manage content across the site from a single interface.
-   **"View all" button**: Quickly navigate to a specific channel to view all entries within that channel. Great for reviewing and updating content at a glance.
-   **"Add new" button**: Simplify content creation with a dedicated button for adding new entries directly within a chosen channel, speeding up the content creation workflow.
-    **Allows reduced reliance on singles**: Utilise Entry Types for index pages such as news, resources or blogs. No longer will users be lost to where to find pages.
